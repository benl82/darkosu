# dosu
This repo aims to introduce math to osu!mania (and other rhythm games), and solve any questions someone could possibly have about the game.

**Read "torch time.ipynb" for the current ML model. Work In Progress**

## Requirements
Please install R version 4.1.3 or newer, Python 3, and .NET 4.0 or newer. 

Recommended but not necessary to get an IDE capable of running R. If you want, download RStudio or VSCode, though everything can be done from the terminal.
## Current Features
**Speed generator** - Generate Korea Streams to your heart's content.

**Rudimentary replay parser** - Please run the executable file (written in C code).
## Future Features
### Other Map Generators
**Archetype Map Generator** - Generate your favorite speed / jumpstream / handstream / chordjack maps.

**Difficulty Index** - The question that has eluded us forever: How hard is this map? How much PP should it give?

**SV Sightreadability** - Put in a map and we'll tell you how sightreadable SVs are. (Results may vary if your scroll speed is really high or really low).

**Enhanced Mapping** - Create Frankenstein maps by joining together sections of archetype maps.

**Map Spread Generator** - Want to make a ranked map but don't want to make a spread? Input your top diff and we will generate lower diffs for you.

**How Good Should I Be** - Tell us how good you are (or we can tell you how good you are) and we'll tell you what score you *should get* on a certain map.

**Skillset Balance** - We'll analyze your ranked scores (or any set of scores you want to provide for us) and tell you how balanced your skillsets are.

**Conservation** - We'll tell you how good you could be if you paused.

**GripWarrior** - Tell us how good you want to be and we'll generate fake replays or fake liveplays for you. We'll even generate key macros so you can pretend you're playing the map on a livestream with a clock.

**Taikomania** - Taiko to mania or mania to taiko conversion.

**Key converter** - Convert your favorite 7key maps to 4key or vice versa, or any key to any key. Obviously doesn't work as well if you try converting from 1k to 10k, for example.

**Endless Practice** - Endless archetype practice. Every time you play a note, another note is generated. You can set the stop conditions.

**Map Enjoyability Index** - How fun (or unfun) is a map? Do you hate the map because the map sucks or you suck?

**Map Plagiarism** - Put in two maps and we'll tell you how much one map copies the others (or if they're both just generic maps).

**All of the above in osu!Standard** - Admittedly I don't know anything about osu!standard but I'll ruin the game anyway.
